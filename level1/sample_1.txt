   Some of the striking features of object-oriented programming are:
 	 Programs are divided into what are known as objects.
 	Functions that operate on the data of an object are tied together in the data structure.
 	Data is hidden and cannot be accessed by external functions.
 	Objects may communicate with each other through functions.
 	 New data and functions can be easily added whenever necessary
